## Hi there

I'm Jack Caesar. I mostly work on video games in the Lemnsicate Games series, but have a wide range of software experience and other skills.
Currently a sophomore in college studying computer science as Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

## Experiences
#### Unity
-  [Mana Cycle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864390/Mana_Cycle/). Originally made for TSA Video Game Design competition. An indie game by me and 2 other fellow classmates from high school. Released and self-published on Steam in Summer 2024.
-  Plenty of other games with varying amounts of development time. Many are made for game jams (hackathon-like events but for games). My games released on itch.io can be found [on my itch.io page](https://jackachulian.itch.io).
-  Some of my best Unity game jam games: [Slay Yourself](https://infinityjka.itch.io/slay-yourself), [Scaleton](https://jackachulian.itch.io/scaleton), [Morpho Builder](https://infinityjka.itch.io/gmtk2024)
-  Currently working on a large Action RPG project, codenamed Expedition
#### Godot
- [Which Witch?](https://github.com/jackachulian/CougarJams2024) for the SIUE Cougar Jam 2024, developed in 36 hours with a team of 3 others
- [Expedition](https://github.com/jackachulian/Infinity-Realm-Expedition), a large 3d top-down action RPG project in Godot I'm working on
- [Infinity Realm Trials](https://jackachulian.itch.io/infinity-realm-trials), my first Godot game, made in about 2 weeks
